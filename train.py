"""TODO General-purpose training script for image-to-image translation.

This script works for various models (with option '--model': e.g., pix2pix, cyclegan, colorization) and
different datasets (with option '--dataset_mode': e.g., aligned, unaligned, single, colorization).
You need to specify the dataset ('--dataroot'), experiment name ('--name'), and model ('--model').

It first creates model, dataset, and visualizer given the option.
It then does standard network training. During the training, it also visualize/save the images, print/save the loss plot, and save models.
The script supports continue/resume training. Use '--continue_train' to resume your previous training.

See options/base_options.py and options/train_options.py for more training options.
